Dear Internet,

My name is Ukaza Putro Satya Perdana, also known as *ukazap*, *ukz*, *ukzie*, or more recently *ukzilla*. I'm not a Japanese, I'm a Sino-Javanese Indonesian. The full name consists of Arabic, Javanese, Sanskrit, and Malay/Indonesian words respectively.

  <small>I don't actually look like this in person, I have a condition called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_bitch_face">RBF</a></em>.</small>

I was born and grew up in the [City of Tofu](https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/02/21/kediris-bah-kacung-tofu-tradition-matters.html) (Kediri, East Java). Childhood was fun: I got to taste two different worlds: (1) cycling to the countryside, playing in the mud, flying a kite, etc., and (2) gaming consoles: Nintendo Famicom/NES, SNES, SEGA Genesis, Sony PlayStation 1 & 2 (I have SNES, to play other systems I visit my friends or go to gaming rental in the weekends).

Then there's PC: the ability to not only play video games, but also play VCDs, doing homework, communications, all in the same machine was such a revelation to me. I was exposed to this cool world of gadgetry at just the right time and I thank my parents for that. The first OSes I used was Windows 95 and 98, my friend Fernanda showed me that it's possible to play PS1 games on PC via emulation, and I abandoned gaming consoles altogether ever since.

At school I was not remarkable, in fact I was an average kid. I had an interest in natural sciences (except for chemistry), but it waned overtime and the only subjects I love were computers. First exposure to programming was Visual BASIC and Pascal, then I learned how to create a blog, then how to customize the look and feel, HTML, CSS, down the web development rabbit hole I went. I studied _Teknik Informatika_ (CompSci) at [UNP Kediri](https://unpkediri.ac.id/) with Human-Computer Interaction/UX on web authentication as my [final year project](javascript:alert('I will link the demo later.')) (it was similar to [Google Prompt](https://9to5google.com/2016/06/20/google-prompt-two-factor-authentication/), but although I built it around the same time Google Prompt was available, I came up with it from other sources of inspiration).

I am a proud [Rubyist](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). I picked up the language during my sophomore, it was a world of difference, the alternatives were either useless or clunky to work with. Ruby is one of the programming languages built for humans first and machines second (to be fair, performance is now decent), and it literally changed my life and I got my first full-time job thanks to Ruby.

Around the time when I was going to receive my bachelor's degree, Tarina reached out to me on LinkedIn and shared the SDE job opening at [Jurnal](https://www.jurnal.id/id/). I jumped at the opportunity and have never regretted it. This was also the first time I moved out of my parents' house. Working at Jurnal is a truly humbling experience, I am privileged to work with brilliant people and get to work on a nation-scale production environment. I don't waste my time there, every opportunity to learn I always take: developing new features, customizing print client, building frontend, performing deployments, joining the bug roster, maintaining the API, the list goes on. I learned so much in such a short period. Two years later, I left Jakarta for Bali for more adventure.

I'm now working as a lead engineer at [Melalie](https://melalie.com) x [Itsavirus](https://itsavirus.com). I am mainly responsible for backend and infra stuff. I built the Melalie API, including the location-based search functionality. This is a good opportunity to get the feels of working on early and scrappy team, building something from the ground up, and that not only includes the technical side of thing. Then everything changed when the ~~Fire Nation attacked~~ pandemic began: we had to do everything and more to keep us afloat: working improbable projects and long hours, and yet here we are now: [Team Not Dead](https://twitter.com/i/status/1203327618050920448).

I enjoys laying a foundation on which other developers build. I am pragmatically obsessed with automation and generalization, and I tend to look at things [holistically](https://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/) (as oppossed to focusing too much on the machine, or on the other end of the spectrum: the customers). I prefers working on my own but I can also work with other human beings, but I despise meta-works and red tapes. I love being alone but I'm not a sociopath, I won't ship crappy APIs that will make other developers suffer.

I believe tech can solve many things but not everything should be solved with tech. I like my rice cooker dumb and not connected to the Internet. Low tech is better than wrong application of tech that will only make things worse.

I want to write better and use fewer first-person pronouns in my writings.
