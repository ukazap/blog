# Dear Cyberspace,

My name is __Ukaza <small>Putro Satya</small> Perdana__, also known as *ukazap*, *ukz*, *ukzie*, or more recently *ukzilla*. I'm not a Japanese, I'm a Sino-Javanese Indonesian. The full name consists of Arabic, Javanese, Sanskrit, and Malay/Indonesian words respectively.

I am a proud [Rubyist](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) based in Bali, Indonesia (Previously lived in Jakarta for \~2 years). Born and grew up in the [City of Tofu](https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/02/21/kediris-bah-kacung-tofu-tradition-matters.html) (Kediri, East Java).

Enjoys laying a foundation on which other developers build. Pragmatically obsessed with automation and generalization.

Prefers working on my own and despises meta-works and red tapes. I'm not a sociopath, I won't ship crappy APIs that will make other developers suffer.

I am a fan of simple tools: I like my refrigerator dumb and not connected to the Internet.

I wish I could write better and use fewer first-person pronouns in my writings.

I hope the pandemic ends as soon as possible.
