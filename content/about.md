# Dear Cyberspace,


My name is Ukaza Putro Satya Perdana, also known as *ukazap*, *ukz*, *ukzie*, or more recently *ukzilla*. I'm not a Japanese, I'm a Sino-Javanese Indonesian. The full name consists of Arabic, Javanese, Sanskrit, and Malay/Indonesian words respectively.

  <small>This pic is not accurate, I have a rare condition called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_bitch_face">RBF</a></em>.</small>

I am a proud [Rubyist](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) based in Bali, Indonesia (Previously lived in Jakarta for ~2 years). I was born and grew up in the [City of Tofu](https://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/02/21/kediris-bah-kacung-tofu-tradition-matters.html) (Kediri, East Java).

I work as a lead engineer at [Melalie](https://melalie.com) x [Itsavirus](https://itsavirus.com). I am mainly responsible for backend and infra stuff.

Enjoy laying a foundation on which other developers build. Pragmatically obsessed with automation and generalization.

Prefers working on my own and despises meta-works and red tapes. I'm not a sociopath, I won't ship crappy APIs that will make other developers suffer.

I am a fan of simple tools: I like my refrigerator dumb and not connected to the Internet.

I wish I could write better and use fewer first-person pronouns in my writings.
